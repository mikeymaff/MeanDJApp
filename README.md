Mean DJ App
===========

This is a MEAN Stack based app that will provide the website and api for a DJ Song Request Application.

There will be 2 types of users - DJ's and Fans. DJ's can create a "Party" and Fans can request songs for that specific party. Multiple song requests will be handled like Reddit links where popular requests float to the top. Fans can either upvote existing requests or add their own request.
